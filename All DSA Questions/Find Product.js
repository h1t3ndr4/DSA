// Description

// You are given five numbers stored in variables with the following names

// one, two, three, four, five

// Find the product of the five values, and print it

// Input
// The first and the only line of the input contains five values, stored in the variablesone, two, three, four, five

// Output
// Print the product of the five values stored in the variablesone, two, three, four, five

// Sample Input 1

// 1 2 3 4 5
// Sample Output 1

// 120
// Hint

// In the sample test case, the values stored in the variables areone = 1, two = 2, three = 3, four = 4, five= 5

// The sum of the values is1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120, which is the required sum

function findProduct(one, two, three, four, five) {
  var result = one * two * three * four * five;
  console.log(result);
}
